I have been thinking about how the cursor of text editors can keep track of their col position in a row.

after much look into this feature which is mostly barely notice, i found and decided to follow this write up(https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) by antirez(antirez.com) to build my own text editor.

the goal of this project, is to understand the internal 'mechanics' of popular terminal based text editors
like vim.

To run this project, build with make and run executable.
